Pass: teste!

# Navigation on the app
Entering the application you'll see the requests. <br />
Click "join party" on any of them to join a chat room, you'll see all the messages and can send your own. <br />
In the home screen swipe left and fill the fields to make a new request (which will also make a new chat room).

# Map 
After giving the necessary permissions the map might not load instantly, click the map button again in the bottom navigation bar to make it work. <br />
The map loads the wrong position on the marker, but clicking the button on the top right will take you to your position.
<br />
If after everything recommended it doesn't work, it might be a bug from the compiled .apk. <br />
Because the version installed directly from android studio works fine.

# Scanner
After giving the necessary permissions the scanner might not load instantly, click in any part of the screen to make it work.
